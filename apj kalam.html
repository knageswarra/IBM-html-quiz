				1. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full
				Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,
				was born on October 15, 1931, in
				Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.<br><br>
				2.He served as the 11th President
				of India from 2002 to 2007.<br><br>
				3.Kalam earned a degree in
				aeronautical engineering from the
				Madras Institute of Technology and in
				1958 joined the Defence Research and
				Development Organisation (DRDO).<br><br>
				4.In 1969, he moved to the Indian
				Space Research Organisation, where he
				was project director of the SLV-III, the
				first satellite launch vehicle that was
				both designed and produced in India.
				<br>
				5. He also played a
				pivotal organisational, technical,
				and political role in India's Pokhran-II
				nuclear tests in 1998, the first since
				the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
				6. From 1992 to 1997 Kalam
				was scientific adviser to the defense
				minister, and he later served as principal
				scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the
				government with the rank of cabinet minister.
				7. His prominent role in
				the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
				solidified India as a nuclear power and
				established Kalam as a national hero,
				although the tests caused great concern
				in the international community.
				8. In 1998 Kalam put
				forward a countrywide plan called
				Technology Vision 2020, which he described
				as a road map for transforming India from
				a less-developed to a developed society
				in 20 years. The plan called for, among
				other measures, increasing agricultural
				productivity, emphasizing technology as
				a vehicle for economic growth, and
				widening access to health care and
				education.
				9. Kalam received <b>7</b>
				honorary doctorates from <b>40</b>
				universities. The Government of India
				honoured him with the <b>Padma Bhushan
					in 1981</b> and the <b>Padma Vibhushan
					in 1990</b> for his work with ISRO and
				DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor
				to the Government.
				10. In 1997, Kalam received
				India's highest civilian honour, the
				Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to
				the scientific research and modernisation
				of defence technology in India.
				11.In 2013, he was the
				recipient of the Von Braun Award from
				the National Space Society "to recognize
				excellence in the management and leadership
				of a space-related project".
				12.While delivering a
				lecture at the Indian Institute of
				Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and
				died from an apparent cardiac arrest on
				<b>27 July 2015</b>, aged 83.
